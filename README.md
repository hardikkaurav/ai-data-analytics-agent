AI Data Analytics Agent

This project is an AI-powered data analytics tool that helps users quickly understand structured datasets without writing manual analysis code. It automates common data analysis steps and explains the results in simple, natural language.

The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between raw data and decision-making by combining traditional data analysis with Generative AI.
